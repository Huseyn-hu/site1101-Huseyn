      <p>
        I am interested in the connection between mathematics, creativity, and modern technology. I enjoy reading, drawing, volunteering, leadership, and organizing meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to grow as a mathematician, continue my studies at a top university, and contribute to research that connects mathematical thinking with creative ideas. I love understanding how ideas work, solving problems, teaching others, and creating things that have both structure and beauty.
