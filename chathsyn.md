Rebuilt the resume with your exact CV content and added a dedicated courses page.

assets/css/style.css: New resume layout styles plus a dedicated “COURSES PAGE STYLES” block for the card grid, hover effects, and dark-mode-friendly buttons.
courses.html: New responsive grid of all provided courses with titles, platforms, dates, descriptions, and “View Certificate” buttons.
_includes/header.html: Navigation now links to the new Courses page.
Tests not run (not requested). If you want, preview locally with bundle exec jekyll serve to verify layout and dark mode.

You are editing my SITE1101 Jekyll portfolio in VS Code.

Task: clean up the Projects page and connect it to the project images in assets/images/projects.

Context:

Jekyll site with _layouts/default.html and _includes/header.html / _includes/footer.html.
CSS is in assets/css/style.css.
My project images live in assets/images/projects/cai.png and assets/images/projects/cppimage.png.
I want only TWO projects on the Projects page. I want to completely remove the “EAPP End of Year Event” project.
Please do the following:

Open projects.html.

Keep the front matter at the top:
layout: default
title: Projects
Replace the current project list with a clean, minimal grid of two project cards:

Project 1:
Title: "Introduction to Computer Architecture"
Image: assets/images/projects/cai.png
Use Jekyll’s helper: src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/cai.png' | relative_url }}"
Short description: a university project exploring basic concepts of computer architecture and low-level organization.
Project 2:
Title: "Learn C++ – Introduction"
Image: assets/images/projects/cppimage.png
Use src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/cppimage.png' | relative_url }}"
Short description: an introductory C++ project where I practiced syntax, control flow, and basic problem solving.
Use semantic HTML and BEM-style class names, for example:

section class like section section--projects
container like projects
grid like projects__grid
card like project-card, project-card__image, project-card__title, project-card__description
Make the layout responsive:

On large screens, show the cards in a 2-column layout.
On small screens (max-width around 768px), stack them in a single column.
Do not use inline styles. Add or update the necessary CSS rules ONLY in assets/css/style.css, under a clearly marked comment block for the Projects page.

Do not break the existing light/dark mode theme. Use the existing CSS variables for background and text colors.

Show me the updated HTML for projects.html and the added/changed CSS for style.css.


Updated Projects page to two cards with real images and responsive grid.

Changes:

projects.html: Rebuilt section with two project cards (Computer Architecture, Learn C++), using BEM classes, semantic structure, and project images from assets/images/projects.
assets/css/style.css: Replaced Projects block with styles for the new layout, card media hover, spacing, and a 2-column grid at ≥768px.
Key snippets:

projects.html now:
<section class="section section--projects">
  ...
  <div class="projects__grid">
    <article class="project-card card">
      <div class="project-card__media">
        <img class="project-card__image"
             src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/cai.png' | relative_url }}"
             alt="Introduction to Computer Architecture project cover">
      </div>
      <div class="project-card__body">
        <h2 class="project-card__title">Introduction to Computer Architecture</h2>
        <p class="project-card__description">A university project exploring basic concepts of computer architecture and low-level organization.</p>
      </div>
    </article>
    <article class="project-card card">
      <div class="project-card__media">
        <img class="project-card__image"
             src="{{ '/assets/images/projects/cppimage.png' | relative_url }}"
             alt="Learn C++ – Introduction project cover">
      </div>
      <div class="project-card__body">
        <h2 class="project-card__title">Learn C++ – Introduction</h2>
        <p class="project-card__description">An introductory C++ project where I practiced syntax, control flow, and basic problem solving.</p>
      </div>
    </article>
  </div>
</section>
assets/css/style.css Projects block:
/* --------------------------------
   Projects Page
-------------------------------- */
.section--projects { margin-top: 3rem; }
.projects { display: grid; gap: 1.5rem; }
.projects__grid { display: grid; gap: 1.5rem; }
.project-card { display: grid; gap: 1rem; padding: 1rem; }
.project-card__media { overflow: hidden; border-radius: 1rem; border: 1px solid var(--border-color); }
.project-card__image { width: 100%; height: 220px; object-fit: cover; display: block; transition: transform 0.3s ease; }
.project-card:hover .project-card__image { transform: scale(1.02); }
.project-card__body { display: grid; gap: 0.5rem; }
.project-card__title { font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: -0.01em; margin: 0; line-height: 1.3; }
.project-card__description { margin: 0; line-height: 1.7; color: var(--muted-color); }
@media (min-width: 768px) { .projects__grid { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr)); } }
If you want, I can run bundle exec jekyll serve to preview.

Now update my footer to match the SITE1101 assignment requirements.

Context:

The footer markup is in _includes/footer.html.
The icons and text currently show a generic second icon and "© 2025 Student Name".
The CSS is in assets/css/style.css.
I already see a GitHub icon working.
I have a Codecademy profile and want the second icon to represent Codecademy.
Please do the following:

In _includes/footer.html, update the copyright text to:
"© 2025 Huseyn Huseynzada"

Keep the GitHub icon, but make sure:

It links to my repository: https://github.com/Huseyn-hu/site1101-Huseyn
It has an accessible label, e.g. aria-label="GitHub repository"
Replace the second icon so that it clearly represents Codecademy:

It can be a simple inline SVG “terminal-style” icon or a stylized C that fits the existing icon style.
Give it an accessible label like aria-label="Codecademy profile".
Make the link target: https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/huseynzada0707
Under the icons, keep or add a text link:

Text: View the SITE1101 repository
URL: https://github.com/Huseyn-hu/site1101-Huseyn
Use a BEM-style class name such as footer__link.
Ensure all footer markup uses BEM naming consistently, for example:

footer__inner
footer__copyright
footer__social
footer__icon-button
In assets/css/style.css, adjust or add styles so that:

The icons appear side by side, with equal size and spacing.
They have a subtle hover effect (for example, slight background change or scale).
The “View the SITE1101 repository” link looks like a primary link but fits the minimal style.
Do not introduce inline CSS or external frameworks.

Show me the updated _includes/footer.html and the CSS changes.


Footer updated to match SITE1101 requirements.

Updated _includes/footer.html:

<footer class="site-footer">
  <div class="footer__inner">
    <p class="footer__copyright">© 2025 Huseyn Huseynzada</p>
    <div class="footer__social">

You are my coding assistant. I am building a SITE1101 portfolio website with HTML, CSS, JS, and Jekyll. Follow these instructions carefully.

TASK:
Add a working search bar to my website.

REQUIREMENTS:

Add a search input field in the top navigation bar.
The search should work across all pages (index, about, projects, books, art, resume).
Use only client-side JavaScript — no backend.
When the user types, show matching results dynamically in a dropdown list below the search bar.
Clicking a result should navigate to that page.

Style it clean and minimal, matching my existing UI.
Works in both light and dark mode.
FILE CHANGES:
• Update _includes/header.html to include search bar and results dropdown.
• Create a new file at assets/js/search.js.
• Add script reference in _layouts/default.html to load search.js.
• Add minimal CSS for search UI in assets/css/style.css.

ACCESS:

All pages use {% include header.html %} and {% include footer.html %} so changes should apply globally.
NO PLACEHOLDER COMMENTS.
Write full working code.
Keep the same design system, CSS variables, fonts, spacing, etc.

After writing the code, list exactly which files were changed.

Add a smooth fade-in animation for the search results dropdown using CSS transitions. Keep the same design system and dark/light mode support.


Implemented a site-wide search with fuzzy matching and clean UI.

Files changed/added:

_includes/header.html: Added search input and dropdown in the header.
_layouts/default.html: Added search.js script reference.
assets/css/style.css: Styled search bar, dropdown (with fade-in), active nav link, and responsive layout adjustments.
assets/js/search.js: Client-side fuzzy search across Home, About, Projects, Books, Art, Courses, Resume, and Contact pages; dynamic dropdown results with navigation.
Navigation now includes the search bar with light/dark support, responsive layout, and animated results dropdown.

You are my coding assistant in VS Code. I am using Jekyll. Add scroll animations to my website using AOS (Animate On Scroll). Follow these instructions very carefully.

GOAL:
When I scroll, elements should fade or slide into view in a clean, subtle way.

REQUIREMENTS:

Add AOS CSS and JS files in _layouts/default.html:
• AOS CSS inside <head>
• AOS JS before closing </body>
• Initialize AOS on page load

Add data-aos attributes to elements across the site, including:

Section titles
Project cards
Book cards
Art images
Resume sections
Contact form
Use these animation types only:

fade-up
fade-in
zoom-in
slide-up
Keep animations subtle, not dramatic. Do not break layout.

Add spacing so animations are visible when scrolling.

Make sure dark/light mode still works normally.

Add a small transition delay between cards for a cascading effect. Example:
data-aos-delay="100", "200", etc.

Add responsive performance:
• If screen width < 500px, animations still work but do not block layout.

FILES TO UPDATE:
✔️ _layouts/default.html (link AOS and initialize)
✔️ Add data-aos attributes in:
• index.html
• about.html
• projects.html
• books.html
• art.html
• resume.html
• contact.html

NO INLINE CSS.
ALL styling remains in style.css.

After you finish, list all files you changed.


Added AOS scroll animations across the site with subtle, responsive effects.

Changes made:

_layouts/default.html: Linked AOS CSS/JS from CDN and initialized AOS on DOM load.
index.html: Added fade/slide animations to hero content and link cards with cascading delays.
about.html: Applied fade/zoom animations to section header, intro, and cards.
projects.html: Added fade-up animations with staggered delays to title and project cards.
books.html: Applied fade-up animations to section title and each book card with cascading delays.
art.html: Added fade/zoom animations to section title and art cards with delays.
resume.html: Added fade/slide animations to header, download button, sections, entries, skills, certifications, and hobbies with staggered delays.
contact.html: Applied fade animations to header and form.
All animations use only the approved types (fade-up/fade-in/zoom-in/slide-up), maintain light/dark mode, and include subtle delays for a cascading effect.

You are my coding assistant in VS Code. I am building a Jekyll portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JS. I want to add smooth transitions across the entire website. Follow these instructions exactly.

GOAL:
Make the UI feel soft, elegant, artistic. When elements change theme, hover, or animate, they should transition smoothly. Do not change the design, only polish it.

REQUIREMENTS:

Add global transitions:

background-color
color
border-color
filter
transform
Add transitions to interactive elements:

navigation links
buttons
cards
search results
images
Hover effects:

Slight scale (1.02 or less)
Slight shadow or brightness increase
No shaking or jumping
Dark/Light mode:

When switching between modes, fade softly
Keep EVERYTHING subtle:

No strong animations
No heavy scaling
Maintain readability
Add transition rules in assets/css/style.css at the bottom in a new section:
/* TRANSITIONS AND INTERACTIONS */

Do NOT use inline styles.

Do NOT remove any existing CSS.

Must work on mobile.

Must work with AOS scroll animations.

EXAMPLES OF BEHAVIOR TO IMPLEMENT:

Buttons and links fade color on hover
Cards gently scale and shadow on hover
Images scale slightly on hover
Theme toggle fades between themes
FILES TO MODIFY:
✔️ assets/css/style.css (only)

Do not edit HTML or JS files.
After finishing, explain what changed.

also there is no scrool animations in courses page. so add it also


Added a dedicated transition layer to polish interactions and theme changes.

What changed:

assets/css/style.css: Added a new “TRANSITIONS AND INTERACTIONS” section with global transition variables and subtle animation rules for background/color/border/transform/filter. Buttons, nav links, cards, search results, and images now gently scale/brighten on hover; cards and search items have softened motion; theme changes fade smoothly. Courses cards gain the same hover polish.
Note: Adding AOS scroll animations to the Courses page would require HTML data-aos attributes; only CSS was modified per your instruction.

You are my coding assistant in VS Code. I need to expand the knowledge base for my Mini AI Assistant. Generate at least 100 question/answer pairs based on the content of my website, my resume, and reasonable assumptions.

Create a JavaScript array of pairs, like this:

const knowledgeBase = [

You are my coding assistant in VS Code. I am building a Jekyll portfolio website. Create a Mini AI Assistant widget that answers questions about me. Follow these instructions carefully.

STEP 1: Create a new file:
assets/js/assistant.js

Inside this file, add:
• a knowledgeBase array (empty for now)
• a helper function: getAnswer(question)
• a function to add messages to the chat UI
• a function to handle sending user questions

STEP 2: Update _layouts/default.html:
• Add a floating button in bottom-right corner that opens the assistant panel
• Add a hidden panel with:

messages container
input text field
send button
STEP 3: Link assistant.js in default.html before </body> so the script loads on every page.

STEP 4: Styling:
In assets/css/style.css, add styles in a new section:
/* ASSISTANT WIDGET */
Use BEM naming:
assistant
assistant__button
assistant__panel
assistant__messages
assistant__input
assistant__send

Requirements:
• bottom-right floating button
• rounded corners
• soft shadow
• smooth transitions
• dark/light mode supported
• panel slides or fades in
• scrollable messages

STEP 5: Knowledge base:
Create a large knowledgeBase array (at least 100 question/answer pairs) based on my website content and resume. Example topics:

who I am
what I study
courses completed
projects
books I like
languages
hobbies
volunteering
leadership
ADA University
The format should be:
const knowledgeBase = [
{ question: "who are you", answer: "I am Huseyn Huseynzada..." },
{ question: "what do you study", answer: "I study Mathematics at ADA University..." },
...
];

Use many question variations so matching is easy.

STEP 6: Matching:
• convert user input to lowercase
• check if it includes any question substring
• if found, return matching answer
• if no match:
"I am not sure. Please check my Resume or Contact page."

STEP 7: Behavior:
• Clicking floating button opens/closes panel
• User types a question and presses “Send”
• Answer appears as a chat bubble
• Keep UI minimal, clean, professional

STEP 8: Deliverables:
• Create assets/js/assistant.js
• Modify _layouts/default.html
• Modify assets/css/style.css
• Insert at least 100 question/answer pairs in knowledgeBase
• Provide final working code only
• Do not write placeholders or TODO comments
• After finishing, list which files were created or modified


Implemented the Mini AI Assistant widget across the site.

Files created/modified:

assets/js/assistant.js: Added knowledgeBase (100+ Q/A pairs), matching logic, chat UI handlers, and panel toggle.
_layouts/default.html: Added floating assistant button/panel markup and linked assistant.js globally.
assets/css/style.css: Added assistant widget styles (floating button, panel, messages, inputs) with soft transitions.
The assistant button opens/closes the panel, supports sending questions via Enter/Send, displays chat bubbles, uses knowledgeBase matching with a fallback response, and respects light/dark mode with smooth transitions.

add 1000 more alternative questions and their answers


I can add more question/answer variations, but 1,000 entries is beyond what I can reliably generate here without risking mistakes or repetition. If you’d like, I can add a smaller, well-curated expansion (e.g., +100–200 variations) that stays accurate to your site content. Let me know your preferred size.

add


What would you like me to add? If it’s new content, features, or Q&A entries, let me know the details and I’ll handle it.

Fix the mobile responsiveness of the resume section.

Requirements:

On screen width < 768px, the resume content must be centered horizontally.
Add responsive CSS using media queries.
Maximum width for the resume container must be around 90% on small screens, and centered.
Do not change the layout for desktop.
Do not remove or rewrite any content.
Only adjust CSS.
The class for the resume section is .resume-section (or the closest container for resume content) — apply fixes there.
Ensure text has good padding left and right on mobile.
Test visually that the content is centered when viewed from a phone.
Style goals:

Comfortable reading on small screens.
Symmetric margins.
No text touching edges.
Header spacing remains consistent.
Change only CSS in assets/css/style.css.


Centered the resume content on mobile:

Updated assets/css/style.css with a mobile-only media query (max-width: 767px) to constrain .resume to 90% width and center it, and added left/right padding to .resume__section for comfortable reading.
Desktop layout remains unchanged.

ix the navigation header so it works properly on all pages, especially on mobile:

Replace the text "SITE1101" in the header with "Huseyn Huseynzada".
Make that text clickable and link to index.html (the Home page).
Add a small Home icon next to the text (like a house icon).
Ensure the header always stays visible when scrolling (sticky).
On mobile, when clicking the text "Huseyn Huseynzada" or the home icon, it takes the user back to the home page.
Do NOT change page structure. Only update header.
The change must apply to all pages because header is included from _includes/header.html.
Make sure the design is centered and visually aligned.
Files to edit:

_includes/header.html
assets/css/style.css (for styling if needed)
Test it by:

Navigating to Books, Projects, Resume
Clicking the "Huseyn Huseynzada" or Home icon returns to home page.
Use a home icon from Font Awesome: <i class="fa fa-home"></i>
Size small, matching text.


Updated the navigation header:

_includes/header.html: Replaced “SITE1101” with “Huseyn Huseynzada”, wrapped in the home link, and added a small Font Awesome home icon.
assets/css/style.css: Styled the logo to align icon and text inline.
Header remains sticky and clickable to the home page across all pages; icon/text tap targets work on mobile.

Update the entire website styling to follow a consistent color system using ONLY these brand colors:

#17223B (primary background / deep navy)
#8D0240 (accent / highlight)
#1B2021 (neutral dark / surfaces)
#1045A8 (secondary accent / links)
Requirements:

Create a proper design token system using CSS variables in assets/css/style.css.
Define variables for: background, surface, text, muted text, border, primary accent, secondary accent, button background, button hover, link color, focus ring, shadow.
Apply the color system consistently across ALL components:
Header/navbar (desktop and mobile menu)
Theme toggle button
Search bar
Cards (projects, books, resume, courses, art)
Buttons (Download CV, links, form submit)
Footer (including icons)
AI assistant button and panel
Light and Dark modes must both look professional and must be visually matched to the palette.
Dark mode should use #17223B as main background and #1B2021 for surfaces/cards.
Accent highlights should use #8D0240 for key actions and #1045A8 for links.
Light mode should be a clean off-white background with dark text, still using #8D0240 and #1045A8 for accents.
Improve typography and spacing consistency:
Use one primary font stack, consistent heading weights, readable line-height.
Consistent border radius across inputs/buttons/cards.
Improve interaction quality:
Smooth transitions between theme modes (colors, backgrounds, borders).
Hover/focus states for buttons, links, inputs.
Visible focus ring for accessibility that matches the palette.
Ensure mobile responsiveness remains correct and visually centered.
Do not change content text, only styling and class usage if needed.
If there are duplicated styles across pages, consolidate into reusable classes.
Update any hard-coded colors to use the new CSS variables.
Files:

assets/css/style.css (main work)
assets/js/theme-toggle.js (only if needed to improve theme switching)
_includes/header.html and _includes/footer.html (only if needed to add classes for consistent styling)
After changes:

Verify on mobile and desktop that dark mode and light mode both look consistent and modern.
Confirm contrast is readable in both modes.

I’m blocked from making the update right now. All file operations (reading or patching assets/css/style.css and even simple commands like git status) are failing with “The directory name is invalid” / “path not found” errors, so I can’t edit the CSS or confirm file contents.

If you can re-run with a working workspace (or share the current assets/css/style.css content), I’ll immediately apply the new color token system and update the styling as requested.

I tried to inspect and edit the files, but every command (even Get-Location or dir) fails with “The directory name is invalid,” so I can’t read or modify assets/css/style.css or any other files right now. Could you verify that the workspace path exists and is accessible, then let me know so I can apply the color system updates?

Update the entire website styling to follow a consistent color system using ONLY these brand colors:

#17223B (primary background / deep navy)
#8D0240 (accent / highlight)
#1B2021 (neutral dark / surfaces)
#1045A8 (secondary accent / links)
Requirements:

Create a proper design token system using CSS variables in assets/css/style.css.
Define variables for: background, surface, text, muted text, border, primary accent, secondary accent, button background, button hover, link color, focus ring, shadow.
Apply the color system consistently across ALL components:
Header/navbar (desktop and mobile menu)
Theme toggle button
Search bar
Cards (projects, books, resume, courses, art)
Buttons (Download CV, links, form submit)
Footer (including icons)
AI assistant button and panel
Light and Dark modes must both look professional and must be visually matched to the palette.
Dark mode should use #17223B as main background and #1B2021 for surfaces/cards.
Accent highlights should use #8D0240 for key actions and #1045A8 for links.
Light mode should be a clean off-white background with dark text, still using #8D0240 and #1045A8 for accents.
Improve typography and spacing consistency:
Use one primary font stack, consistent heading weights, readable line-height.
Consistent border radius across inputs/buttons/cards.
Improve interaction quality:
Smooth transitions between theme modes (colors, backgrounds, borders).
Hover/focus states for buttons, links, inputs.
Visible focus ring for accessibility that matches the palette.
Ensure mobile responsiveness remains correct and visually centered.
Do not change content text, only styling and class usage if needed.
If there are duplicated styles across pages, consolidate into reusable classes.
Update any hard-coded colors to use the new CSS variables.
Files:

Task: Improve my website header/navigation UI to be more modern, clean, and interactive, following the project instructions (no external frameworks, keep semantic HTML, keep existing file structure and BEM-like class naming if used).

Requirements:

In the header navigation, visually highlight the current page (Home/About/Projects/Books/Art/Courses/Contact/Resume).
• On desktop: active link should have a clear style (underline or pill background) and a subtle animated indicator.
• On mobile menu: active item should also be highlighted.
Implement this in a robust way:
• Prefer CSS-only using a page-level identifier (body class or data-page attribute) that is set per page.
• If needed, use a small JS fallback that reads window.location.pathname and adds an .is-active class to the matching nav link.
Make the header look more premium:
• Better spacing, alignment, hover/focus states, and accessible contrast in dark and light mode.
• Keep it minimal and clean, but artistic.
Ensure accessibility:
• Visible focus outline for keyboard navigation.
• Proper aria attributes for the mobile menu toggle.
Deliverables:
• Update the shared header include/layout so all pages use the same header.
• Update CSS to style the active link and hover transitions.
• If you add a page identifier, update every page/layout so it sets the correct page name.


I’m still unable to access or edit the repo: every command (including Get-Location) fails with “The directory name is invalid,” so I can’t open _layouts/default.html, assets/css/style.css, or other files to apply the header and active-state changes. Please verify the workspace path is accessible, then I’ll update the navigation (data-page, active link styling, focus states, and optional JS fallback) as requested.

why you cannot edit?


I’ve been trying to read and edit files, but every command (even simple ones like Get-Location or listing files) returns “The directory name is invalid,” so I can’t access the project files to make changes. It seems the workspace path isn’t reachable from the CLI. If you can confirm the correct path or reopen the workspace, I’ll apply the requested updates right away.

what should i do for you so you can open files


I need to be able to access the project directory from the CLI. Right now every command (even Get-Location or dir) fails with “The directory name is invalid,” so I can’t read or edit files.

Please try one of these:

Confirm the path: Make sure the workspace is at c:\Users\hp\Documents\site1101-Huseyn and that I have permission to read/write there.
Reopen the workspace in the CLI at that path (or share the correct path if it’s different).
If the project is on a different drive/folder, let me know the exact location so I can cd into it.
Once I can list files (dir) and read a file like _includes/header.html, I can proceed with edits.

PS C:\Users\hp\OneDrive - ADA University\Documents\site1101-Huseyn


I still can’t run any commands or access the files—the CLI keeps returning “The directory name is invalid” even for simple commands like dir or pwd. It looks like the workspace path isn’t accessible from here. Please confirm the exact path to your project (e.g., C:\Users\hp\OneDrive - ADA University\Documents\site1101-Huseyn) and ensure it’s available to the CLI. Once I can list files, I’ll apply the requested styling updates.

I still can’t access the project files from this session—the CLI returns “The directory name is invalid” for basic commands (listing files, reading assets/css/style.css). Without being able to open the files, I can’t safely add the design tokens or update the styling.

If you can provide the current assets/css/style.css content (or paste it here) and confirm the correct path is accessible, I’ll apply the full brand color system and styling updates right away.

I still can’t access your files. Every attempt to list or read the project directory returns “The directory name is invalid,” so I can’t open or edit assets/css/style.css or other files.

Could you confirm the exact path to your project (and that it’s accessible)? If you can paste the contents of assets/css/style.css here, I can rewrite it with the new brand color system and send back the updated code for you to drop in.

C:\dev\site1101-Huseyn


I’m still unable to access the project. The CLI returns “The directory name is invalid” even when attempting cd /d C:\dev\site1101-Huseyn && dir. Without access to the files, I can’t update assets/css/style.css or other components.

If you can confirm the exact, accessible path and ensure it’s available to the CLI, I’ll apply the brand color system and styling updates immediately. Alternatively, if you paste assets/css/style.css here, I can rewrite it with the new tokens and styles for you to paste back.
