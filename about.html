        I am Huseyn Huseynzada, a Mathematics student at ADA University in Baku, Azerbaijan. I am interested in the connection between mathematics, creativity, and modern technology. I like understanding how mathematical ideas work in real life and how creative thinking can make those ideas more meaningful.

      <p>
        I enjoy reading, drawing, volunteering, leadership, and organizing events. These activities help me grow as a communicator and as a team member, and they also keep me connected to my artistic side. I like learning new things, solving problems, and helping other people learn.

        My goal is to become a strong mathematician and continue my studies at one of the top universities in the world. I want to use mathematical thinking in research and in the technologies we use today. Machines do not think creatively, but people do, and I want to use that creative ability to build ideas that are useful and inspiring.
